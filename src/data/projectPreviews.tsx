                For my Hack the North 2025 Frontend Application I was tasked
                with creating an event viewing app with a multitude of features
                and a clean UI. I used NextJS and TailwindCSS to create a
                responsive and fast website that would allow users to view
                events, sort them, and even share them with friends. To view
                private events you can use the hardcoded username and password,
                user: hacker, password: htn2025. You can check out the source

                Amid the fast-paced rhythm of university life at Waterloo, one
                universal experience ties us all together: the geese. Whether
                you&apos;ve encountered them on your way to class, been woken up
                by honking at 7 am, or spent your days trying to bypass flocks
                of geese during nesting season, the geese have established
                themselves as a central fixture of the Waterloo campus. How can
                we turn the staple bird of the university into a asset? Inspired
                by the quintessential role the geese play in campus life, we
                built an app to integrate our feather friends into our academic
                lives. Our app, Goose on the Loose allows you to take pictures
                of geese around the campus and turn them into your study
                buddies! Instead of being intimidated by the foul fowl, we can
                now all be friends!

                symptoms. The app suggests further questions, over-the-counter
                medications, homeopathic remedies, and common treatments, also
                providing a likely diagnosis. Users can track different symptom
                sets over time through multiple sessions. RapidRx reduces the
                time needed to find and book a doctor and mitigates risks from
                unreliable online searches, crucial for the 6 million Canadians
                without a family doctor. The app offers an efficient way to
                manage health concerns, saving time and providing peace of mind.

                printed out, I then soldered all of the components and
                programmed the board using C++. I also designed a custom case
                for the project as well as keycaps. The final project includes 7
                fully programmable keys, a 128x64 OLED screen. I also created an
                API to help port over information that I needed. This includes

                This website is made using NextJS, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS.
                I wanted to make a website that was simple, yet elegant, and I
                think I did pretty good. Here is where I&apos;ll showcase my
                projects, and the technologies I used to create them. I may also
                post some blogs or something later!
